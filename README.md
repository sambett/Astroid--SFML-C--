## 🎮 Game Features

- **Classic Arcade Experience**: True to the original Asteroids gameplay
- **Smooth Controls**: 
  - Rotate ship with arrow keys
  - Thrust with UP arrow
  - Fire with SPACE
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic momentum and inertia
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game becomes more challenging as score increases
- **Particle Effects**: Visual feedback for explosions and thrust
- **Sound Effects**: Retro-style audio for actions and collisions

## 🛠️ Technical Features

- **SFML Integration**: Utilized for:
  - Window management
  - Sprite rendering
  - Collision detection
  - Audio playback
  - Input handling
- **Vector Mathematics**: Custom implementation for movement and physics
- **Entity Component System**: Modular game object management
- **Collision System**: Efficient collision detection between game objects

## 🔧 Building the Game

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- SFML 2.5.1 or later
- CMake (optional, if using build system)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/asteroids-game.git
cd asteroids-game
```

2. Install SFML:
- **Windows**: Download from SFML website
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
- **macOS**: `brew install sfml`

3. Build the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Run the compiled executable
2. Use arrow keys to control the ship
3. SPACE to shoot
4. Destroy asteroids to score points
5. Avoid collisions with asteroids
6. Press ESC to pause/exit
