A modern reimplementation of the classic Asteroids arcade game using C++ and SFML library. This project was created as a learning exercise to demonstrate C++ game development skills.


## üéÆ Game Features

- **Classic Arcade Experience**: True to the original Asteroids gameplay
- **Smooth Controls**: 
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic momentum and inertia
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game becomes more challenging as time increases
- **Particle Effects**: Visual feedback for explosions and thrust
- **Sound Effects**: Engaging Background music

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

- **SFML Integration**: Utilized for:
  - Window management
  - Sprite rendering
  - Collision detection
  - Audio playback
  - Input handling
- **Vector Mathematics**: Custom implementation for movement and physics
- **Entity Component System**: Modular game object management
- **Collision System**: Efficient collision detection between game objects

## üîß Building the Game

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- SFML 2.5.1 or later
- CMake (optional, if using build system)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/asteroids-game.git
cd asteroids-game
```

2. Install SFML:
- **Windows**: Download from SFML website
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
- **macOS**: `brew install sfml`

3. Build the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
